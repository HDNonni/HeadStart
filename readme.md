 how to represent ships on a grid ( in 3 out of 7 cells)
 get user input prompt vs input number 0-6
 display output , alert vs ???


 pseudoCode
 declare 3 variables to hold the location of each cell of the ship
 loc1
 loc2 
 loc3
 variable to hold user guess
 varible to hold hits = 0
 variabel to hold guesses = 0
 variable to track whether or not ship sunk = false

 the logic 
 loop while ship is not sunk
 get users guess
 compare user inout to valid input values
 IF user guess is invalid
  tell to enter valid #
ELSE add one to guesses
    add one to # of hits
    IF number hits ==3
    set sank to true
    tell user You sank my battleship

end if
    if
    else
    loop

answer the who am I question

I get passed into a function.: argument
I send values back to the calling code.:return
I’m the all important keyword.:variable X should be function
I’m what receives arguments.: functions X should be parameters
It really means ‘make a copy’.:pass by value
I’m everywhere.:global variable
Another phrase for invoking a function.: function call
Example of a function attached to an object. Math.random
alert and prompt are examples.:built in functions
What functions are great for.:code resuse
Where I can be seen.:scope
I’m around when my function is :parameter X local variable

objects are simply a collection of properties

a reference to an object goes into a variable , not the object itself

arguments in functions are passed by value ie pass by copy

objects contain state and behavior
    properties allows 'state' on an object (ie current song on radio);
    methods allows behavior (ie starting car, turn up heat)

    objects can contain functions , theses are called methods
    across
    2. an object get *behavior* with its emethods
    6. The method log is a property in the *console    * object
    8. 'this' is a *keyword* not a regular variable
    10.To access the property of an object we use *dot* notation
    11.*methods *can have local variables and parameters just like functions
    13.We used a *make * property to represent the make of the car object
    14.The *addFuel* method affects the state of the car object by adding to the amount of fuel in the car

    down
    1.The fiat wouldnt start because we werent using *THIS* to access the started property
    3.Object references are passed by*VALUE* to functions just like primitive variables
    4. When you assign an object to a variable , the variable contains a *reference* to the object
    5.We usually use one *WORD* for property names
    7. The name and value of a property in an object are spearted by a *colon*
    9.Don't forget to use a *comma* after each property value except the last one
    12.Car and dog objects can have both *state* and behavior 


    event handler and callbacks
    use functions to package up code that can be called when some event happens
    some events are generated by the browser while others by a user interacting with a page ie click etc..

    string methods
        toLowerCase
        lastIndexOf -last occurrence
        replace- finds substrings and replaces with another string
        concat
        slice- returns a new string that has par of original removed
        substring-returns a portion of a string
        trim-removes whitespace from around the string
        match

        working on Battleship , stuck on parseGuess FIXED

        random ships function 
        *put in order

        3. generate a random location for the new ship 

        1. loop for the number of ships we want to create

        4.  X should be 2. generate a random direction (vertical / horizontal) for the new ship
        
        2. X should be 5 add the new ship's location to the ships array
        
        5. X should be 4.  test to see if the new ships locations collide with any existing ships locations

    Event Handlers (callbacks / listeners)

    window.onload to be sure page loaded before script runs

asychronous code is code that is invoked later if and when an event occurs

definitions
Target - Hold object on  which the event occcurred, most often an element object

Types - a string like 'click' or 'load' that tells what just happened

timeStamp - When an event happened

keyCode - what key user pressed

clientX - how far side to side of browser window

clientY - how far top to bottom of browser window

touches - how many fingers touched the screen

Code written to handle events is different from code
that executes top to bottom and then completes. Event
handlers can run at any time and in any order: they are
asynchronous

a function designed to react to an event is called an event handler

function declarations vs function expression

when browser parses the page it looks for function declarations 1st when it finds one if assign the resulting reference to a variable with the same name as the function

Function declarations are evaluated
before the rest of the code is evaluated.

Function expressions get evaluated
later, with the rest of the code.

A function declaration doesn’t return a
reference to a function; rather it creates
a variable with the name of the function
and assigns the new function to it.

A function expression returns a
reference to the new function created
by the expression.
❏
a function reference is a value that refers to a function

You can hold function references in
variables.

The process of invoking a function
created by a declaration is exactly the
same for one created with an expression.

Function declarations are statements;
function expressions are used in
statements.

An expression is anything that
evaluates to a value. 3+4 evaluates to 7,
Math.random() * 6 evaluates to a random
number, and a function expression evaluates
to a function reference. 

First Class : a value that can be treated like any other value in a progamming language including the ability to be assigned to a variable , passed as an argument and returned from a function

❏ You can assign functions to variables.
❏ You can pass functions to functions.
❏ You can return functions from functions

function reference is a first class value

array sort method takes a function that knows how to compare two values in an array

If code expects a function reference then a function expression can be put in its place because expressions evaluat to a function reference;
If a fucntion is expected as an argument , it can be passed an expression which again evaluates to a reference before it is passed;
Same thing if you need to return a function from within a fucntion , just return a funciton expression


within a function, if you define a nested function with a declaration,
that nested function is defined everywhere within the body of
the function. On the other hand, if you create a nested function
using a function expression, then that nested function is defined only
after the function expression is evaluated.

lexical : to determine the scope of avariable by reading the structure of the code as opposed to waiting until the code runs to figure it out

Remember that JavaScript functions are always
evaluated in the same scoping environment in which
they were defined. Within a function, if you want to
determine where a variable is coming from, search in
its enclosing functions, from the most nested to the least.

Closure, noun: A closure is a function .”
together with a referencing environment.

 a function typically has
local variables in its code body (including any parameters it has),
and it also might have variables that aren’t defined locally,
which we call free variables. The name free comes from the fact
that within the function body, free variables aren’t bound
to any values (in other words, they’re not declared locally
in the function). Now, when we have an environment that
has a value for each of the free variables, we say that we’ve
closed the function. And, when we take the function and the
environment together, we say we have a closure. 

A closure results when we combine a
function that has free variables with
an environment that provides variable
bindings for all those free variables.

 You
create a closure whenever you have a reference to a function that has free variables,
and that function is executed outside of the context in which it was created. 

One thing that often misleads people learning closures is that they think the environment in the
closure must have a copy of all the variables and their values. It doesn’t. In fact, the environment
references the live variables being used by your code, so if a value is changed by code outside your
closure function, that new value is seen by your closure function when it is evaluated.

A function declaration is defined
before the rest of your code is
evaluated.
 A function expression is evaluated
at runtime with the rest of your
code, and so is not defined until
the statement in which it appears is
evaluated.
 You can pass a function expression
to another function, or return a
function expression from a function.
 A function expression evaluates to a
function reference, so you can use
a function expression anywhere you
can use a function reference.

Lexical scope means that we can
determine the scope of a variable by
reading our code.

Closures are a function along with a
referencing environment. 

A closure captures the value of
variables in scope at the time the
closure is created.
 Free variables in the body of a
function are variables that are not
bound in the body of that function.
 If you execute a function closure in
a different context in which it was
created, the values of free variables
are determined by the referencing
environment.
 Closures are often used to capture
state for event handlers.

object constructors
The first thing new does is create a new, empty object:

Next, new sets 'this' to point to the new object

For object constructors The only thing
you don’t want to do is return a value
(other than this) from a constructor
because that will cause the
constructor to not return the object
it’s supposed to be constructing. 

Match parameter and property names for clarity

When you call a constructor
(to create an object) the value of
this is set to the new object that’s
being created so all the code that is
evaluated in the constructor applies
to that new object. 

Later, when you call a method on
an object, this is set to the object
whose method you called. So the
this in your methods will always
refer to the object whose method
was called. 

Remember that 'new' first creates a new object before assigning it to this (and
then calling your constructor function). If you don’t use 'new', a new object will never be created.
❏ That means any references to this in your constructor won’t refer to a new object, but rather, will refer to the global object of your application,
in browsers that is thw indow object.
❏ If you don’t use 'new' there’s no object to return from the constructor, which means there is no object assigned to the darkside variable

read page 535 for clarification of the 'new' keyword and constructors

Webpages that we see in our web browsers make up the Web; the network of interconnected computers around the world that enable us to see those web pages make up the Internet.
Websites are static, meaning they are not updated—at least not all that often.
Web applications are a whole different beast. Like desktop applications (Word, Photoshop, Skype), web applications are dynamic and ever-changing. They rely on you to interact with them, whether by contributing content (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook) or by gathering data from other sources and presenting it to you (Mint, Google Analytics, Klout) or a little bit of both!

constructed objects can have their own properties

You can do the same with objects created from constructors:
Here's our dog Fido, created
with the Dog constructor.

var fido = new Dog("Fido", "Mixed", 38);

We can add a new property just by
assigning it a value in our object.
Or we can get rid of a property by
using the delete operator.

fido.owner = "Bob";
delete fido.weight;

You can even add new methods if you like:
To add a method just assign the method
to a new property name in the object.

fido.trust = function(person) {
};

return (person = = = "Bob");

Anonymous function alert!
See, they're everywhere!

Notice that here we’re changing only the fido object. If we add a method
to fido , only fido has that method. No other dogs have it:
This code works because trust is defined in
the fido object. So notBite is true.

var notBite = fido.trust("Bob");
var spot = new Dog("Spot", "Chihuahua", 10);
notBite = spot.trust("Bob");
This code doesn't work because spot doesn't have
a method trust, resulting in: “TypeError: Object
#<Dog> has no method ‘trust’"

prototype objects , where objects can inherit and extend the behavior of other objects, create extensions oof other objects
when an object inherits form another it gains access to all its methods and properties
JavaScript uses what is known as prototypal
inheritance, and the object you’re inheriting behavior from is called
the prototype.
When you call an object’s method, this is
set to the object whose method was called.
If the method is not found in that object,
and is found in the prototype, that doesn’t
change the value of this . this always
refers to the original object—that is, the
object whose method was called—even if
the method is in the prototype. So, if we
find the bark method in the prototype,
then we call the method, with this set to
the original dog object, giving us the result
we want, like “Fluffy says Woof !”.
